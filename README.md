# Scripts

Description: A repo containing scripts that I've worked on in my personal time and at work (non-internal).

Index:
1. caclWoWChanges.py - uses the numpy and pandas libraries to work with Excel data sheets and 
calculate the week over week (WoW) changes for each client.
2. findValidIP directory - contains sample files and Python scripts that traverses and finds all distinct IP 
addresses within all files and subdirectories of the root directory specified and prints them in lexicographical 
order. Additional details can be found within the directory.
